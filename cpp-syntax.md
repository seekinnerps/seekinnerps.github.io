# C++ Syntax Review

C++ is a powerful programming language with a rich syntax that allows for great control over system resources. In this section, I'll be reviewing some important C++ syntax, such as:

- **Variables**: Declaring and initializing variables
- **Control Structures**: if, else, switch, for, while
- **Functions**: Function declaration and definition
- **Classes & Objects**: Object-oriented features of C++
- **Templates**: Using templates for generic programming

Stay tuned for more in-depth explanations and examples!
